# Java-Game-Assignment

## Project introduction / overview
This project was designed to demonstrate my knowledge of Java Swing concepts and GUI, applying features such as event handling, collision detection, object-oreiented programming, and class inheritance and abstract classes, to create a simple game with smooth gameplay. For my project, I have designed a falling object game, called "Galaxy Glide", where the player must avoid falling objects and collect other objects in order to gain points. Initally, the project started with a simpler version of my game, that was AI generated code with minimal functionality. I have added some features to the code and made my own modifications to it, to improve the game and allow it to run smoothly, providing an enjoyable UI experience.

## What the project does
I have created a Java Swing game called "Galaxy Glide", where the player (ufo) collects falling stars for points and dodges asteroids. The ufo movement is controlled by left and right arrow keys, and there are multiple levels to the game: easy, medium, and hard. There is a point/scoring system and the player is given 3 lives to start. Galaxy Glide is a falling object game, with yellow stars that give 5 points, rarer blue stars that give 10 points, hearts that grant the player another life, all while avoiding the falling asteriods. Players must first create an account by registering in order to play the game and their highest score is saved in the account.

## How to run the program
Copy and paste the code into CodeHS and create image files and upload the images. 
When "run" is pressed, the game will immediately run and stop when all lives have run out. To play again, press the "start" button at the bottom of the game.

## Project goals or purpose
The goal for this project was to create a simple Java Swing game, with event handling, layout managers, file I/O, collision detection, and classes and inheritance. The purpose of this assignment was to apply GUI knowledge from unit 4. Another goal was to create an enjoyable UI (user interface) experience and get feedback exhchange. This was achieved by first taking a basic AI code and making making my own modifications on it.

## Installation or setup instructions
Copy and paste the code into CodeHS and create image files and upload the images, found above the "Read Me" page.
